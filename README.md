# DamonBot

DamonBot is a chatbot built for CloudFlare's team chat. The intention of this project is to provide a fun, semi-useful tool that CloudFlare employees can easily hack and extend. The framework that spawned DamonBot, and enables DamonBot to work in a chat platform indepdent way, is called [MultiBot](http://github.com/cdata/multibot).

## About the name

This bot is called DamonBot after Damon, who is the tireless head of customer support and our awesome community manager at CloudFlare. The bot's personality is, to a limited extent, modeled in his image.
